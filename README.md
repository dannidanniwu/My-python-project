# Analysis of 2022 Monkeypox Outbreak using Python

Part 1: Exploratory analyses of the 2022 Monkeypox Outbreak. The dataset contains information on approximately 40,000 patients. Each row represents one patient information, including age, gender, county, etc. The analysis mainly uses Plotly, Pandas, and Wordcloud modules to create user-friendly interactive plots. We have data visualizations for missingness, the geographic distribution of confirmed cases, the trend of confirmed cases over time, the distribution of most common symptoms, and gender.

Part 2:  A comparison of the genomic sequence of the monkeypox case from NYU with the standard monkeypox genomic sequence. To run the code, simply install/import all dependencies including MAFFT for the alignment (!conda install -c biocore mafft --yes) and run the notebook in the same folder as the three fasta files (.fasta or .fa) listed in the file inventory below.
